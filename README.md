- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS-native solutions with Infrastructure as Code
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines and monitoring
- **Engineering Excellence**: Clean code, comprehensive testing, and detailed documentation

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend**: React, NextJS, Astro, TypeScript, Modern CSS  
**Backend**: Node.js, RESTful APIs, and RPC  
**Cloud**: AWS  
**Infrastructure**: Terraform, CDK, GitHub Actions  
**Ecommerce**: 5+ years building scalable retail platforms  
**Practices**: Observability, Documentation-First Development

### üìö Personal Website

This repository showcases a production-ready personal website built with modern engineering practices:

- **üèóÔ∏è [Architecture Overview](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Comprehensive system design with AWS services, security considerations, and performance optimizations
- **üìã [Project Documentation](./docs/PROJECT.md)** - Complete project structure, technology stack, and deployment commands
- **‚ö° [Engineering Excellence](./docs/ENGINEERING_EXCELLENCE.md)** - My core engineering philosophies covering ownership, documentation, observability, and testing

**Key Features:**

- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform modules
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Security-first design with HTTPS everywhere and private S3 access

### üéØ Engineering Philosophy

I believe great software engineering is built on four pillars:

1. **Ownership** - Taking full responsibility for code quality and system health
2. **Documentation** - Clear communication of intent and architectural decisions
3. **Observability** - Making systems transparent with proper monitoring and alerting using Grafana Cloud, Dynatrace, and CloudWatch
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage from unit to end-to-end

### üì´ Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing software engineering, cloud architecture, and building scalable systems. While most of my professional work is proprietary, you can learn more about my projects and experience on my personal website. I'm also working on **Sonafied**, a passion project that showcases my technical interests outside of work.
